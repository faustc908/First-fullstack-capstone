I want to expand on an application I made called GoodEats earlier in the course.  I want to refractor it into React, add some animations and additions, and expand the search query using the backend.
Instead of only being able to search for one ingredient You can use several.  I will use the website Edamam which is an api for recipes and filter it through node to expand the search parameters.
Cooking is a big interest of mine and I've gotten good feedback on my last app so I want to improve on it.
